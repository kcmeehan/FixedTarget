This is the documentation for the Glauber Monte-Carlo Model 
that can do centrality binning and error estimation.
--------------------------------------------------------------

OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------------------
This code is used to determine the centrality cuts on data.  
The code fits the negative binomial distribution generated by 
the Glauber model to a pion multiplicity histogram obtained 
from data.  This process is repeated four times, and the fit 
with the lowest chi-squared is used in the next step.  The 
pion multiplicity distribution from the winning run is 
integrated to obtain the centrality cuts.  A table of these 
cuts is printed to the terminal at the end.


STEP-BY-STEP
--------------------------------------------------------------
1. Running the Glauber Model Simulation:
Open the bash script runGlauberSimulation.sh and edit the 
options as needed.  The code is well-commented. Probably the 
only option(s) that might need changing are the number of 
nucleons (currently set to run for Au on Al).  Save the changes. 
Run the Glauber simulation by typing the command...

      ~$  ./runGlauberSimulation.sh

2. Get the Pion Histogram From Data:
Obtain the pion multiplicity histogram from the data.  Save this 
as a .root file. Copy the path.

3. Determining the Centrality:
Open the bash script runCentralityDetermination.sh and edit the 
options as needed.  The code is well-commented.  The first two 
options should need to be changed as follows.

      dataFileName=<path to the root file containing the histogram from data>
      dataHistoName=<the name of the histogram within the root file>

Also change the bin center value where the fitting algorithm 
should start.  This stops the model from getting thrown off 
because of inefficiencies at detecting low pion-multiplicity events.

      normStartBinCenter=<bin center of where to start fitting>

Save the changes.  Run the centrality determination by typing the command...
   
       ~$ ./runCentralityDetermination.sh

Be sure to save the output to the terminal.  In particular, 
the model with the largest 1/chi-squared, and whatever 
centrality cut you need.
