#DavisDstAnalysis
  
	DavisDstAnalysis is a collection of compiled root macros to create AuAu proton 
	spectra and dndy for the 2015 data.

##Installation
	
	 Getting the Code - You can clone the DavisDSTAnalysis repository into a 
	 directory of you choice by doing: 
	 git clone https://sheppel@bitbucket.org/sheppel/protondavisdstanalysis.git 
	 Then, get the code of the submodules by doing: 
	 
	 	git submodule init 
		git submodule update 
	 
	 If you are prompted for a password at any time during this process simply hit enter. 
	 After this completes you will have all the code.
	
	Compile code with "make" in directory davisdstanaylsis/.

##Run

	In the directory davisdstanalysis/scripts/. are a list of scripts to run the analysis.
	
	The full analysis can be run using ./RunFullAnalysis.bash. Within the script, 
	the user must specifiy the data directory, image directory, analysis directory, 
	correction file, nEvents, energy, eventConfiguration, starlib, centIndex and system Label.

	The user specifies the baseNames of the produced root files and the scripts 
	generates the root files in the analysis directory.

	If the user prefers to run individual sub-processes of the analysis:
	
	#1 RunSkimmerAndBinner.bash (with option 0)
		
		Reads the davisdst-analysis files and produces a histogram file 
		with 3D histograms of the proton dEdx, mt-m0 and rapidity for dEdx fitting 
		as well as tof, mt-m0 and rapidity for tof fitting. 
		First pass does not bin include tofCut with option 0.

	#2 RunFitZTOFProtons.bash

		Reads the 3D histogram file and fits the tof histograms. 
		Fits are stored in $tofFitFile and used when rerunning RunSkimmerAndBinner.bash 
		with option 1.

	#3 RunSkimmerAndBinner.bash (with option 1)

	   	Second pass of the script reads the davisdst-analysis files and generates 
		tof cut 3D histogram files.

	#4 RunFitZTPCProtonsTofCut.sh 

		Reads the tofCut yield histogram file and fits dedx of the tofCut Protons. 
		The clean tof cut signal produces a $protonWidthFile 
		used in the ./RunFitZTPCProtons.sh for better fit constraints.
		
	#5 RunFitZTPCDeuteronsTofCut.sh 

		Reads the tofCut yield histogram file and fits dedx of the tofCut Deuterons. 
		The clean tof cut signal produces a $deuteronWidthFile 
		used in the ./RunFitZTPCProtons.sh for better fit constraints.
	   
	#6 RunFitZTPCProtons.sh 

		Reads the yield histogram file and fits dEdx of 
		the protons, pions, e+, kaons, and deuterons. Proton and deuteron width 
		and centroid values are from the $protonWidthFile and 
		$deuteronWidthFile respectively.   
		Script generates the uncorrected spectra.
		
	#7 RunCorrectSpectra.sh 

	   	Uncorrected spectra file is corrected with correctionFile.root.
		Additionally, the corrections are individually applied to the uncorrected 
		spectra and the average deviation is calculated for the spectra systematic errors.  	
	#8 DrawProtonSpectraNoFit.sh

		Runs macro that draws proton spectra.

	#9 RunFitThermalProtonSpectra.sh

		Corrected spectra is fit with a Blastwave fit and a thermal fit. Using the 
		difference of the fits, the systematic errors are calculated. Produces $dndyFile.

	#10 RunFitdNdy.sh

		Lastly, the script fits the dNdy in the $dndyFile with a double gaussian 
		and saves a pdf of the fit.  


	That's all there is!
